			<Char_Desc_2000>Boolean Algebra assistant program
is an interactive program extremely easy to use.
A must-have tool for the freshmen electrical 
engineering student.
The program is intended for the developers of small 
digital devices or simply of radioamateurs, and as 
for those who is familiar with Boolean algebra, for 
the electrical engineering students. The program 
allows to minimize Boolean function by a graphic 
method of Karnaugh maps. A must-have tool for the 
freshmen electrical engineering student.
The given program is called to facilitate 
minimization of Boolean function by a method of 
Karnaugh maps. The program has the simple and 
convenient interface, evident image of received 
results of minimization.The program draws the 
so-called largest circle and displays the prime 
implicant solution. 

Program Features:
  -= Shows output in either SOP or POS format 
  -= Create circuit from boolean formula
  -= Handle maximum 8 boolean variables
  -= Will find and eliminate redundant terms 
  -= Will handle don't care conditions. 
  -= Allows you to click on a term in a given expression and view it on the map. 
      The program will indicate the corresponding term with a fill cells. 
  -= Draws 2,3, 4, 5,6,7,8  variable Karnaugh Map 
  -= Simplifies expressions that you type in.
  -= Fill map with several ways -[ Truth table, Sets, Boolean formula  ] 
  -= Multi lingual user interface. You can add your native language to program.
  -= Allow to edit variables names to different than A,B,C... etc.
  -= Export Map to HTML table to easyer creation of synthesis reports.
  -= Automated creation of reports.</Char_Desc_2000>
